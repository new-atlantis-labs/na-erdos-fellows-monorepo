  description: |
    The Global Ocean Colour (Copernicus-GlobColour) dataset provides Level 4 Bio-Geo-Chemical products from satellite observations for monitoring the global ocean's health.
    Variables include Chlorophyll-a concentrations and primary production rates among others.
    The data is available in NetCDF-4 format, providing monthly updates and finer daily interpolations.
  keywords: [ocean, satellite observations, chlorophyll, primary production, global monitoring]
