        description: The first test is done on data in real time as it is collected. This test applies QC in real time for immediate QC values. A second, more thorough, post-processing algorithm is applied to the data that are exported to
the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) datastore. See https://buoybay.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/CBIBSQCCodeMeanings_2.pdf

        instrumentUsed:
          - name: Buoy weather station
            description: The Airmar 200WX-IPX7 measures wind speed, wind gust, wind direction, and air temperature. It also has an integrated GPS receiver that tracks buoy position and a barometer that measures air pressure.
        variablesIncluded:
        - wind speed
        - wind gust
        - wind direction
        - air temperature
          - name: Buoy water quality sensors
            description: CBIBS buoys use sensors to monitor water-quality parameters including water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a. Salinity and temperature are the key measurements we report; other parameters are also measured at some locations. CBIBS tracks these parameters at 0.5 meters below the water’s surface.
        variablesIncluded:
        - water temperature
        - salinity
        - dissolved oxygen
        - turbidity
        - chlorophyll-a
          - name: Buoy current profiler
            description: The profiler provides current speed and current direction at one-meter levels from the surface to the bottom. The current as reported on the CBIBS website and database is an average of the upper five meters. The CBIBS standard instrument is a NORTEK AquaDopp. It measures currents by analyzing acoustic (1 mHz frequency) reflections from the moving water below the instrument over a five-minute period ten times per hour.
        variablesIncluded:
        - current speed
        - current direction
          - name: Buoy Acoustic Receiver
            description: Innovasea VR2W data-logging computers attached to the bottom of the buoy “listen” for tagged fish. When a 69 kHz signal is identified, the transmitter tag's unique ID code is saved with the date and time. The data from any single receiver provides a record of each visit to that location by a tagged fish. The data are uploaded to the Mid-Atlantic Acoustic Telemetry Observation System when the receivers are retrieved from the field.
        variablesIncluded:
          - name: Buoy wave measurement system
            description: The SeaView SVS-603 is a highly accurate wave sensor that reports wave height, wave period, wave direction, and more via RS-232 and logs wave data, energy spectra, acceleration, and more.
        variablesIncluded:
        - wave height
        - wave period
        - wave direction
